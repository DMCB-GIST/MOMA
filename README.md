# MOMA: A Multi-task Attention Learning Algorithm for Multi-omics Data Interpretation and Classification

MOMA is a **multi-task attention learning model** that provides a general classification framework for **multi-data**. <br/>
MOMA can capture **important biological processes for high diagnostic performance** and **interpretability**.<br/>
The model vectorizes features and modules using a geometric approach, and focuses on important modules in multi-omics data via an attention mechanism.
